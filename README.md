# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-smartphone-data

The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.
Per-processing on the smartphone sensors are already done. 
###This is a great project for ML begineers. 
###This is a time-series project. 
###Plotting of time-series data is also available in the jupyter notebook.
